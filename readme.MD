Apologies for committing directly to main -- I'll set it up so we can only push branches and need PRs. I've got it at a point where if we run `go run main.go` it works (but still gives a exit status 1). I figured we can create a netpol binary that takes an argument (netpol generate, etc.) and play around with that. It would probably help if we figure out bite size chunks that we can divide up and work on so I'm not stepping on your toes?
