Apologies for committing directly to main -- I tried to setup branch protection but that's a "pro" feature :(. In the future I'll create a branch and create a PR. I've got it at a point where if we run `go run main.go` it works (but still gives a exit status 1). I figured we can create a netpol binary that takes an argument (netpol generate, etc.) and play around with that. It would probably help if we figure out bite size chunks that we can divide up and work on so I'm not stepping on your toes?
